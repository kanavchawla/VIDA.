    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <div class="para"><p>"No one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of others,‚Äù - Charles Dickens<br><br>

        We are a team of four members, Kush Gupta, Aarush puri, Kanav Chawla, and Arjun Kalra, and are First year college Students at Thapar Institute of Engineering Technology, Patiala, Punjab, India. We all started this initiative with our friend and founding member Mr. Arjun Kalra acting as a driving force for us to build an application that takes care of various health related practical problems.
        <br><br>
        VIDA is a mobile and web based application which serves as a major medical assistance for you. It does a lot of things ranging from storing your medical documents, ensuring availability of medicines in local pharmacies and also trying to systematically plan deliveries of your medicines to your homes. The ultimate feature of the mobile application of VIDA would be that it would function as an SOS app and help anyone in problem due to any certain medical condition.

        Above anything we believe in the above quote by Sir Charles Dickens, and would love to try and build a community which is healthy from its foundation. </p></div>
